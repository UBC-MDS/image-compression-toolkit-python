# Contributing

image-compression-toolkit-python is an open source project, and we welcome contributions of all kinds: new methods for compression and resizing, fixes to existing material, bug reports, and reviews of proposed changes are all welcome.

## Contributor Agreement

By contributing, you agree that we may redistribute your work under our license. In exchange, we will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we can, and help you become a member of our community. Everyone involved in image-compression-toolkit-R agrees to abide by our code of conduct.

## How to Contribute

The easiest way to get started is to file an issue to tell us about some unexpected compression or wrong resizing. This is a good way to introduce yourself and to meet some of our community members.

If you do not have a GitHub account, you can send us comments by email. However, we will be able to respond more quickly if you use one of the other methods described below.

If you have a GitHub account, or are willing to create one, but do not know how to use Git, you can report problems or suggest improvements by creating an issue. This allows us to assign the item to someone and to respond to it in a threaded discussion.

If you are comfortable with Git, and would like to resolve an existing issue that's been labeled by the maintainers or typos/bugs, you can submit a pull request (PR). If you want to add new functions, you can fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes. Make sure to write test cases to test your code and check that all the tests are passing before submitting the PR. If you'd like to suggest substantial changes, please first raise an issue to allow the maintainers to comment, so we can discuss whether/how these changes should be made.
